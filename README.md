# The Biblically Accurate Macropad

This is a custom, 3d-printed macropad made to resemble a biblically accurate angel, powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040. <br/>

My intial goal for this project was to just simply make something cool for the summer and to keep me occupied, but soon grew into a very complex CAD and art project that I had loads fun working on. I learned lots of useful techniques in Fusion 360, such as the Surface modeling tools, Create Form, and the 3D Sketch feature, which I will use extensively in my other work like future hardware projects, school work, and for my team in VEX Robotics. I also plan to show off this project to my IRL Hack Club at my high school to promote Hack Club to more students. <br/>

The macropad is powered with a RP2040 soldered into a PCB in the dodecahedron in the center, and has external rings of key switches surrounding the center, all wired to the center PCB. To fit the biblically accurate angel theming, the macropad has a motif of eyes, which is commonly seen in interpretations of biblically accurate angels online. The case is also made out of gold PLA filament, with the center, keycaps, and some decorations painted white to fit the color scheme often associated with angels. <br/>
The angel is also called bobby :)))) <br/>
