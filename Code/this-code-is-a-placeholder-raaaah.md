# uhm what
the code here is currently a placeholder for what the final firmware *should* be! It was made with QMK, and will be changed once I get the macropad built for an easier time customizing which buttons are which (since I can test it on the spot) <br/>

## UPDATE!!!!!
this new code now uses QMK's custom firmware features! the .uf2 file is the compiled firmware uploaded to the RP2040, while the two .json files are part of the adafruit/pico_pad keyboard folder thingy idk <br/>
* keyboard.json replaces the premade one in qmk_firmware/keyboards/adafruit/pico_pad, while the keymap.json file goes into the keymaps folder (and into the desired keyboard folder if made)
