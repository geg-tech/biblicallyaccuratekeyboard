First entry into the journal! Today I brainstormed a bunch of ideas on what to do for highway, such as:
* combat robot that flips onto opponents with a vertical spinner (slam jam)
* horse racing robots with mash-able "cheer" buttons that have a very small chance to boost the robot forward
* irl V1 wings from ultrakill
  
Ultimately, I decided to choose something that is somewhat within my comfort zone of circuit boards and 3d modeling (though I hope to do the other ones someday),
that being a keyboard in the shape of a biblically accurate angel. I chose this idea due to the existing tutorial on hackpad which should be a great 
stepping stone into this project, while also being unique and funnier from the usual, flat micropads (though I'm unsure if this idea would count as a custom or starter project ðŸ—¿).
  
I have some ideas on what the keyboard should look like, with the shape of the board most likely looking like the usual orb angel with the revolving rings of eyes.

second entry ahhh

This morning I hopped on and decided to start on how i wanted the PCBs to look like. I made a preliminary model of what the keyboard should look like, as well as some research on
possible microcontrollers.
* currently im thinking of using a rp2040-ZERO microcontroller due to the small size and large amounts of pins (20 switches from what i counted), possibly could also use a larger microcontroller like an esp32 from what i read (credit to Adedayo Adeleke on slack for telling me about the rp2040-zero)
* the microcontroller could be located in the center of the angel, with the outer pcbs containing the switches being wired through the supports using copper contacts and soldered on wires
* could also use flex pcbs or ribbon cables to manage the wiring more efficiently, though im completely new to them
