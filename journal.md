First entry into the journal! Today I brainstormed a bunch of ideas on what to do for highway, such as:
* combat robot that flips onto opponents with a vertical spinner (slam jam)
* horse racing robots with mash-able "cheer" buttons that have a very small chance to boost the robot forward
* irl V1 wings from ultrakill
  
Ultimately, I decided to choose something that is somewhat within my comfort zone of circuit boards and 3d modeling (though I hope to do the other ones someday),
that being a keyboard in the shape of a biblically accurate angel. I chose this idea due to the existing tutorial on hackpad which should be a great 
stepping stone into this project, while also being unique and funnier from the usual, flat micropads (though I'm unsure if this idea would count as a custom or starter project ðŸ—¿).
  
I have some ideas on what the keyboard should look like, with the shape of the board most likely looking like the usual orb angel with the revolving rings of eyes.
